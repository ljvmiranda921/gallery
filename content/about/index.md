Hi I'm [Lj Miranda](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io) and welcome to my little
gallery of pixelated photos! 

I take my photos using the original [Game Boy
Camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Camera). It has a resolution of
128x112 pixels, a limited four color palette, and a memory that can hold thirty
photos at a time.  To import my photos digitally, I use a [custom GBxCart RW
cartridge](https://www.gbxcart.com/) and the
[FlashGBX](https://github.com/lesserkuma/FlashGBX) utility program.

I hope you have a great time while you're here. Have fun!
