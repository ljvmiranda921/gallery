Hi I'm [Lj Miranda](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io) and welcome to my little
gallery of pixelated photos! 

## Game Boy Camera

I take my photos using the original [Game Boy
Camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Camera). It is attached to a Game
Boy Color like any other game cartridge. However, I admit it's pretty hard to
use: it only has a small 128x112 resolution, a limited color palette, and small
memory.

Even if it's crude, I enjoy the idea of constraints fueling creativity. I
learned how to look at things differently, correctly time my shots, and be more
economical with how I take photos. It's a fun experience! 

Back then, you could only "save" your photos by printing them using the [Game
Boy Printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Printer). It uses thermal
paper just like a receipt. Of course, this affects your image's quality and is
not ideal. Nowadays, I am using a [custom cartridge](https://www.gbxcart.com/)
to export my photos. That's why you'll find my shots clearer since they're
digitized.

I hope you have a great time while you're here. Have fun!
