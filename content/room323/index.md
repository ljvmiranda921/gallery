I stayed at Room 323 of the [Sacred Heart
Novitiate](https://sacredheart.phjesuits.org/) during the Holy Week Retreat
(organized by [Center for Ignatian
Spirituality](https://phjesuits.org/cisphil/)). Next to my room is the entrance
to the San Jose Seminary. The windows overlook a huge *balete* tree.
