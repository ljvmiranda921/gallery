Outside the [St Anne Catholic Church](https://www.stanneseattle.org/) in Upper Queen Anne.
Normally I'd take the 32 and 4 buses every morning to get there, but the timetables are unreliable so I usually walk for 30-40 minutes listening to Andy Serkis's Lord of the Rings audiobook. 

The mass is usually presided by Fr. Collin Parrish, but I learned that he'll transfer to another parish for his new mission.
