# ljvmiranda921.github.io/gallery 

A showcase of my photos using the [Game Boy Camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Camera).


## Set-up

First, you need to have [Hugo installed in your
system](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo#install-hugo-as-your-site-generator-binary-install).
Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ljvmiranda921/gallery.git
```

If it's your first time cloning this repository, make sure to pull the theme first

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then, start the server:

```sh
hugo server -D
```

And that's it! There's nothing else aside from that. You can add photos by
creating a new folder, then writing an `index.md` that references the photo you
want to display. You can check previous posts as reference.
